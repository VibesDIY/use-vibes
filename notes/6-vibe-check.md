# Step 6: Vibe Check and Feedback

## Goal

Bring the initial implementation back for feedback, ensuring it aligns with the vision and is ready for further development.

## Tasks

1. Create a summary document of progress:

   ```
   /reports
     /vibe-check-1.md    # First vibe check report
   ```

2. The report should include:

   - Summary of completed steps (1-5)
   - Screenshots of working examples
   - Code samples of key implementations
   - Challenges encountered and solutions
   - Questions for further clarification

3. Demonstrate working implementation:

   - Show the basic useVibes function working
   - Provide links to working examples
   - Include console logs showing successful initialization

4. Review against original vision:

   - Check alignment with the philosophical vision
   - Ensure the foundation supports the planned ontology
   - Verify technical approach will scale to full implementation

5. Outline next steps:
   - Propose immediate next development priorities
   - Identify potential challenges
   - Suggest refinements to the approach if needed

## Expected Output

A comprehensive review of the initial implementation with clear examples of functionality, alignment with the vision, and a path forward for continued development. This checkpoint ensures we're on the right track before investing in more complex functionality.
