# useVibes API Implementation Notes

dont add extra files or start the implementation, just get the tests to happen right with the new api surface

## Overview

This document provides a summary of our implementation approach for the new `useVibes` API, including key components, testing challenges, and lessons learned.

## API Structure

We developed the following components for the new API:

1. **Core Interfaces**:

   - `UseVibesConfig` - Configuration interface accepting a prompt and options for capturing page state
   - `VibesApp` - App instance interface with container element and optional database

2. **Key Modules**:

   - `pageCapture.ts` - Utility for capturing HTML, CSS, and visual snapshots of the page
   - `contextProcessor.ts` - Processes captured page state with prompts to generate content

3. **Implementation Features**:
   - Inject-first approach leveraging current page's HTML, CSS, and visual snapshots
   - Configuration options for customizing capture behavior

## Testing Strategy

Our testing approach included:

1. **Unit Tests** (`vibe.test.ts`):

   - Mocking DOM elements for non-browser testing
   - Testing the core `useVibes` functionality
   - Verifying content transformation based on the prompt

2. **Browser Tests** (`hello-world.test.ts`):
   - Using Playwright to test in real browser environments
   - Verifying element transformation and content injection
   - Testing prompt processing and content generation
   - Testing configuration options and error handling

## Implementation Challenges

### Module Bundling and Loading

- **Challenge**: Browser tests had difficulty loading the module correctly
- **Issue**: The tests were trying to import directly from source files but couldn't access them
- **Solution**: We needed to use the bundled IIFE version loaded by the test HTML page instead of direct imports

### DOM Manipulation in Tests

- **Challenge**: Unit tests failed when manipulating DOM elements
- **Issue**: The mock DOM structure wasn't properly set up to match our implementation's expectations
- **Solution**: Need to align mock structure with the actual DOM queries in the implementation

### Configuration Interface

- **Challenge**: Type errors with the `prompt` property
- **Issue**: The TypeScript type definition for `UseVibesConfig` didn't match how we were using it
- **Solution**: Need to update the interface to properly include all required properties

## Lessons Learned

1. **Browser-Node Environment Differences**:

   - Browser tests require a different approach than Node-based unit tests
   - Bundling is essential for browser tests to work correctly

2. **DOM Mocking Precision**:

   - Mock DOM structures must precisely match the selectors and methods used in implementation

3. **Test Isolation**:
   - Use appropriate mocks to isolate browser-specific functionality in unit tests

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Implementation**:

   - Fix TypeScript interface definitions to match implementation
   - Ensure DOM queries are consistent between implementation and tests

2. **Update Test Strategy**:

   - Clearly separate browser and unit tests with appropriate configurations
   - Use the bundled library in browser tests instead of importing source directly

3. **Streamline Error Handling**:
   - Add proper validation and error messages for missing required configuration
   - Implement graceful fallbacks for unavailable browser features
