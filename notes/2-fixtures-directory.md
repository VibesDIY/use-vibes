# Step 2: Fixtures Directory for HTML Challenges

## Goal
Create a proper fixtures/ directory containing HTML test pages that represent different integration scenarios to test our useVibes module.

## Tasks
1. Create fixtures directory structure:
   ```
   /fixtures
     /basic              # Simple HTML pages
       /index.html       # Minimal test case
       /styled.html      # With CSS styling
     /complex            # More complex test cases
       /bootstrap.html   # Bootstrap-based page
       /tailwind.html    # Tailwind CSS page
     /applications       # Real-world application examples
       /todo-app.html    # Simple todo application
       /blog.html        # Blog layout
     /components         # Component-specific test fixtures
       /forms.html       # Various form elements
       /navigation.html  # Navigation patterns
   ```

2. Each fixture should:
   - Be self-contained with inline scripts/styles where possible
   - Include a variety of DOM structures
   - Represent real-world challenges (complex CSS, nested elements, etc.)
   - Have clear target elements for injection (marked with data-attributes or IDs)
   - Include comments for test purposes

3. Create a fixtures index page:
   - List all available fixtures with descriptions
   - Provide direct links to each test case
   - Include instructions for running tests

## Expected Output
A comprehensive collection of HTML test pages that can be used to test the useVibes functionality across different scenarios. These fixtures will serve as the foundation for integration testing and demos.
